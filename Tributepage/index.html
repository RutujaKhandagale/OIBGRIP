			<p>Savitribai Phule was a social reformer, poet and an educationalist. She was the first female teacher of the first women's school in India, started by her and her husband Jyotirao Phule in Pune in 1848.</p>

			<p>After completing her teacher's education, Savitribai Phule started teaching girls at the Maharwada in Pune. She did so alongside Sagunabai Kshirsagar who was a revolutionary feminist as well as a mentor to Jyotirao.<P>
			
			<p>Not long after beginning to teach with Sagunabai, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule along with Sagunabai started their own school at Bhide Wada. Bhide Wada was the home of Tatya Saheb Bhide, who was inspired by the work that the trio was doing. The curriculum at Bhide Wada included traditional western curriculum of mathematics, science, and social studies. By the end of 1851, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were running three different schools for girls in Pune.</p>
			
			<p>Savitribai Phule worked tirelessly for the upliftment of women and Dalits. She was a champion of women's education and fought against social evils like child marriage and sati. Her contribution to the field of education is immense, and she played a crucial role in spreading education among women and the underprivileged in Maharashtra.</p>

			<p>Savitribai and her adopted son, Yashwant, opened a clinic to treat those affected by the worldwide Third Pandemic of the bubonic plague when it appeared in the area around Nalasopara in 1897.</p>
			
			<p>Despite facing immense opposition and discrimination, Savitribai Phule remained steadfast in her beliefs and fought for the rights of all, irrespective of caste, class or gender. Her legacy continues to inspire generations of Indians today.</p>
